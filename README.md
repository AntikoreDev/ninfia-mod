# Ninfia Mod for Balatro
<img align="right" src="https://res.antikore.dev/img/sylveonjoker.gif" alt="Sylveon Joker" width="200">
So I have a friend that is a fan of sylveons, balatro and discovering how to do things with trial and error (and suffering), so I created this mod for him, joining all these things together (including suffering).

This mod adds a Sylveon joker that only appears in a new challenge named "Draining Kiss". You have to discover every behaviour in order to find a good strategy to win the challenge.

Part of the fun is discovering the behaviours by playing and not by looking at the code (Cannot avoid you doing so!)

**Warning:** This mod is frustrating, and it swears and curses, so if you have problem with that, here be dragons!

## How to install
- Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki)
- Download the latest version of the [Source code](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/ninfia-mod/releases/) and put the mod folder into the Mods folder (files should be inside a folder, inside the `Mods` folder)
- Start the game, and enjoy.
